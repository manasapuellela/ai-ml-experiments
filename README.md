# 🧠 AI & ML Experiments

A collection of small, focused **AI/ML experiments**, notebooks, and prototypes built using Python.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate clear thinking, clean implementation, and end-to-end problem solving — from data exploration to model evaluation.

## 📁 Project Structure
This repository contains:

- `notebooks/` → Data exploration, ML experiments, LLM demos  
- `data/` → Small sample datasets (non-sensitive)  
- `src/` → Python scripts for reusable functions  
- `models/` → Saved models (only small ones, not large weights)  
- `reports/` → Visualizations, metrics, observations

## 🔬 What’s Inside
- Classical ML: classification, regression, clustering  
- Feature engineering workflows  
- Model training & evaluation  
- Simple neural network experiments  
- Basic LLM tasks (embeddings, text classification, prompts)  
- Real-world style documentation & explainability  

---

## 🛠 Tech Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- PyTorch (basic)  
- Hugging Face (LLM experiments)

## 🎯 Goal
To show:
- How I think about problems  
- How I write clean, modular Python  
- How I experiment with AI/ML ideas  
- How I document insights clearly
